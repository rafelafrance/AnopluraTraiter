    Remove identical lines.

    Sometimes the OCR model will get stuck in a loop and repeat the same line over and
    over again. Even with a max output tokens setting this can get fairly long. This
    removes duplicate lines. I also only want to remove identical lines if they follow
    one another.

    Note that I want to keep blank lines or lines with all spaces, but I'll still strip
    the spaces at the ends of the line. See the join_lines function for why I want to
    keep empty lines.

    Join lines of text if there is only one line break (return) between them.

    Labels have limited horizontal space, so sentences are split across multiple lines.
    However, the models tend to do better if there are no line breaks in a sentence.
    If there are two or more line breaks in a row then the break is likely to have
    semantic meaning, but if there is only one break then it probably doesn't.
